Concepts and files
==================

*lincs* is based on the following concepts:

- a "domain" describes the objects to be classified (*a.k.a.* the "alternatives"), the criteria used to classify them, and the existing categories they can belong to;
- a "model" is used to actually assign a category to each alternative, based on the values of the criteria for that alternative;
- a "classified alternative" is an alternative, with its category.
