*lincs* is a collection of MCDA algorithms, usable as a C++ library, a Python package and a command-line utility.

Note that *lincs* is not licensed yet, so you don't have any rights besides reading it for now.

# Contributors and previous work

*lincs* is developed by the [MICS](https://mics.centralesupelec.fr/) research team at [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/).

Its main authors are (alphabetical order):
- [Laurent Cabaret](http://perso.ecp.fr/~cabaretl/) (performance optimization)
- [Vincent Jacques](https://vincent-jacques.net) (engineering)
- [Vincent Mousseau](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/fr/2EBDCB86-64A4-4747-96E8-C3066CB61F3D) (domain expertise and project leadership)

It's based on work by:
- [Olivier Sobrie](http://olivier.sobrie.be/) (The "weights, profiles, breed" learning strategy for MR-Sort models, and the profiles improvement heuristic, developed in his [Ph.D thesis](http://olivier.sobrie.be/papers/phd_2016_sobrie.pdf), and [implemented in Python](https://github.com/oso/pymcda))
- Emma Dixneuf, Thibault Monsel and Thomas Vindard ([C++ implementation of Sobrie's heuristic](https://github.com/Mostah/fastPL/))

# Project goals

## Provide MCDA tools usable out of the box

You should be able to use *lincs* without being a specialist of MCDA and/or NCS models.
Just follow the [Get started](#get-started) section below.

## Provide a base for developing new MCDA algorithms

*lincs* is designed to be easy to extend with new algorithms of even replace parts of existing algorithms.
@todo Write doc about that use case.

*linc* also provides a benchmark framework to compare algorithms (@todo Write and document).
This should make it easier to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

# Get started

## Install

First, you need to install a few dependencies (@todo build binary wheel distributions to make installation easier):

<!-- START install/dependencies.sh -->
    # System packages
    sudo apt-get install --yes g++ libboost-python-dev python3-dev libyaml-cpp-dev

--><!-- STOP -->

Finally, *lincs* is available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/lincs/), so `pip install lincs` should finalize the install.

## Concepts and files

*lincs* is based on the following concepts:

- a "domain" describes the objects to be classified (*a.k.a.* the "alternatives"), the criteria used to classify them, and the existing categories they can belong to;
- a "model" is used to actually assign a category to each alternative, based on the values of the criteria for that alternative;
- a "classified alternative" is an alternative, with its category.

## Start using *lincs*' command-line interface

The command-line interface is the easiest way to get started with *lincs*, starting with `lincs --help`, which should output something like:

<!-- START help/run.sh --><!--
    set -o errexit
    set -o nounset
    set -o pipefail
    trap 'echo "Error on line $LINENO"' ERR

    lincs --help >actual-help.txt
    diff expected-help.txt actual-help.txt
--><!-- STOP -->

<!-- START help/expected-help.txt -->
    Usage: lincs [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      lincs (Learn and Infer Non-Compensatory Sorting) is a set of tools for
      training and using MCDA models.

    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      classification-accuracy  Compute a classification accuracy.
      classify                 Classify alternatives.
      generate                 Generate synthetic data.
      learn                    Learn a model.
      visualize                Make graphs from data.
<!-- STOP -->

It's organized using sub-commands, the first one being `generate`, to generate synthetic pseudo-random data.

<!-- START command-line-example/run.sh --><!--
    set -o errexit
    set -o nounset
    set -o pipefail
    trap 'echo "Error on line $LINENO"' ERR

--><!-- STOP -->

Generate a classification domain with 4 criteria and 3 categories (@todo Link to concepts and file formats):

<!-- EXTEND command-line-example/run.sh -->
    lincs generate classification-domain 4 3 --output-domain domain.yml
<!-- STOP -->

The generated `domain.yml` should look like:

<!-- START command-line-example/expected-domain.yml -->
    kind: classification-domain
    format_version: 1
    criteria:
      - name: Criterion 1
        value_type: real

<!-- STOP -->

<!-- EXTEND command-line-example/run.sh --><!--

Then generate a classification model (@todo Link to concepts and file formats):

And finally generate a set of classified alternatives (@todo Link to concepts and file formats):

    lincs generate classified-alternatives domain.yml model.yml 10 --output-classified-alternatives learning-set.csv
<!-- APPEND-TO-LAST-LINE --random-seed 42 -->

It should output something like:

![Alternatives visualization](alternatives.png)

@todo Improve how this graph looks:

- display categories as stacked solid colors
- display alternatives in a color that matches their assigned category
- remove the legend, place names (categories and alternatives) directly on the graph

You now have a (synthetic) learning set.
You can use it to train a new model:

<!-- EXTEND command-line-example/run.sh -->
    # @todo Rename the command to `train`?
    lincs learn classification-model domain.yml learning-set.csv --output-model trained-model.yml
<!-- APPEND-TO-LAST-LINE --mrsort.weights-profiles-breed.accuracy-heuristic.random-seed 44 -->
<!-- STOP -->

The trained model has the same structure as the original (synthetic) model because they are both MR-Sort models for the same domain,
but the trained model is numerically different because information was lost in the process:

--><!-- STOP -->

If the training is effective, the resulting trained model should behave closely to the original one.
To see how close a trained model is to the original one, you can reclassify a testing set.

First, generate a testing set:

<!-- EXTEND command-line-example/run.sh -->
    lincs generate classified-alternatives domain.yml model.yml 100 --output-classified-alternatives testing-set.csv
<!-- APPEND-TO-LAST-LINE --random-seed 43 -->
<!-- STOP -->

And ask the trained model to classify it:

<!-- EXTEND command-line-example/run.sh -->
    lincs classify domain.yml trained-model.yml testing-set.csv --output-classified-alternatives reclassified-testing-set.csv
<!-- STOP -->

There are a few differences between the original testing set and the reclassified one:

<!-- EXTEND command-line-example/run.sh -->
    diff testing-set.csv reclassified-testing-set.csv
<!-- APPEND-TO-LAST-LINE >classification-diff.txt || true -->
<!-- STOP -->

That command should show a few alternatives that are not classified the same way by the original and the trained model:

<!-- START command-line-example/expected-classification-diff.txt -->

You can also measure the classification accuracy of the trained model on that testing set:

<!-- EXTEND command-line-example/run.sh -->
    lincs classification-accuracy domain.yml trained-model.yml testing-set.csv
<!-- APPEND-TO-LAST-LINE >classification-accuracy.txt -->
<!-- STOP -->

It should be close to 100%:

<!-- STOP -->

<!-- EXTEND command-line-example/run.sh --><!--
    diff expected-classification-accuracy.txt classification-accuracy.txt
--><!-- STOP -->

Once you're comfortable with the tooling, you can use a learning set based on real-world data and train a model that you can use to classify new real-world alternatives.
