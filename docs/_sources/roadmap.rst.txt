Roadmap

Here are the changes we consider integrating in the upcomming versions.
This is not set in stone and can change based on the time we can spend working on the project,
external contributions, *etc.*
Items listed in named versions are more likely to happen than items listed in "later versions" and below.

Version 1.1
===========

- Support discrete criteria (with enumerated or integer values)
- Publish the Python API
- Improve graphs produced by ``lincs visualize``; guide users to tweak graphs to their habits

Later versions
==============

- Publish the C++ API
- Support Intel Silicon on macOS

Much later
==========

- Support ARM processors on Linux and Windows
